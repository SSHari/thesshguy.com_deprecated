# Clamp Demos

The following are demos for the css `clamp` utility.

## Max Width Clamp

The following styles are applied to the demo. The clamped class allows for the mixed use of the `max-width` property which constrains the element's max width to `900px` **or** `100%`.

<CodeBlock lang="css" code={maxWidthClampDemo} />
<MaxWidthClampDemo />

## Clamp Anything

The `clamp` util is powerful because it can be used for other properties. The element below has the following styles applied. Notice how the `Demo Text` is clamped between `12px` and `24px`.

<CodeBlock lang="css" code={clampAnythingDemo} />
<ClampAnythingDemo />
